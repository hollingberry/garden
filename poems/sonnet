Sonnet No. 1

A chemiluminescent firefly
A taxidermied elephant in ice
The Paraguayan woman's alibi
A sugarcoated figurine of Christ
A circus girl praying to St. Paul
A pterodactyl and a dodo egg
The poet's verses written on the wall
A veteran of Vietnam's lost leg
A pornographic photo of a nun
An ouroboros choking on its tail
The German Kaiser, Cleopatra's son
A lark believed to be a nightingale
Is beauty but a passing angel's song?
Or does it in the eyes of God belong?
