The Archeotype And The Vindaloo

The archeotype and the vindaloo
Swung slowly in their wedding spoon
The chickadees chirping in the trees
The telephone hum and the sound of bees
When the archeotype to the vindaloo
Spoke upward with a note of doom
"I left at the table a pair of eyes!"
So the vindaloo said, in frank surprise
"Don't worry, honey, you can see through mine!"
Around them still the whistling cries
And under the bridge the creek flowing by
And the archeotype and the vindaloo
Swung softly on in their wedding spoon
