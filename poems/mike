Mike The Hobo

Hello my name is Mike I am a home-less man
I wear a frock, I own a dog, I have a real-good plan
I may seem sorta scruffy but there's nothing that I need
I'm off to Redwood Park to see the Wizard of &mdash;

Oh hello there, kid, I'm sorry &mdash; is this your stuff?
There always is a chance there'll be eight hun-dred bucks
Let me introduce myself, I'm really a nice fellow
I'm mangy as a wild cat but much more mellow

My face is like the moon &mdash; distant, cratered and white
Round as a cherub, filthy as a mite
My hair is like butter &mdash; it's yellow and slick \
I wear a janitor's suit &mdash; it's blue but much too big

My noble home pays homage to Oscar the Grouch
I'm scholarly (like Joseph) on the library couch
Headphones, I've realized, are a govern-ment means
To make its people docile, deferential, and clean

My shower is the pool, and my toilet is the woods
If only I could get a job&hellip; well, I never could
So thank you, here's your money back, I hope that you don't mind
The words that have erupted from my va-grant mind
