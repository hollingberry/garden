To A Flying Fish

Hark! fish of the air, bird of the sea:
trespasser in the Kingdom of Stars,
prisoner in the Kingdom of Waves,&mdash;
trapeze artist swinging from the sun,
tightrope walker perched, like a sparrow,
on a silver wire in Between,&mdash;
&ldquo;&hellip;and faster than a speeding bullet&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;
spinning onstage from whitecapped curtains,
glittering wetness and pirouettes,
a gran jet&eacute; reaching for the moon,&mdash;
Oh! alive, vibrant, writhing muscle,
golden flesh from a honey fountain:
how can we help but call you spirit?
