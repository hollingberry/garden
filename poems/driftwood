A Piece Of Wood

A piece of wood adriftin' on the sea,
through gale and sun, swells and whitecaps,
soaked through, dried out in the sun,
traveling vast oceans to faraway continents,
meeting porpoises and flying fish and algae,
dancing on the ebb and flow,
learning names of flowers and water lilies,
Lucys and Emilys,
singers and circuses,
mathematicians,
barnacles,
hermit crabs,
sailors lost and sailors found,
and through all:
weathered and wettened by the waves,
then parched by salty waters and endless suns,
but the friends along the way!
